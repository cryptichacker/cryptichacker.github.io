<p>OverTheWire is a community which has a collection of fun-filled games which is designed to help the learners in understanding the basics of linux and practice security concepts through CTFs. This posts is on the first 11 levels of the <b>Wargame - Bandit</b>.</p>

One last note before starting, I will only be showing the methods to obtain the flag and not the actual flag since I want you to actually do it. So, if you are looking for flags, this is not the place for you. 

Let's start.

<br>
![level_0](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/0.png)

## <ins>Level 0-1</ins>
---
![level_01](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/3.png)
<br>
The following ```ssh``` command will be used everytime you connect to the machine.
<pre>ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</pre>
<br>
In case you are new to this, ```bandit0``` is ```username```, ```bandit.labs.overthewire.org``` is the ```host machine``` and ```-p``` is used to specify the port.
<br><br>
![ssh_login](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/1.png)
<br>
<pre>cat readme</pre>
<br>
![flag01](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/2.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 1-2</ins>
---
![level_12](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/5.png)
<br>
<pre>cat ./- </pre>
<br>
The ```./``` is used before the file name ```-``` because without it, it is considered as a argument for the command ```cat```.
<br>
![flag12](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/4.png)
<br>


## <ins>Level 2-3</ins>
---
![level23](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/7.png)
<br>
<pre>cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename</pre>
<br>
The spaces in a file name should be escaped for it to be treated as a single file.
<br>
![flag23](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/6.png)
<br>

## <ins> Level 3-4</ins>
---
![level34](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/9.png)
<br>
<pre>ls -la ./inhere; cat .hidden</pre>
<br>
The hidden files are prefixed with a ```.```. So, to see the hidden files use the long listing ```ls -la```.
<br>
![flag34](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/8.png)
<br>

## <ins> Level 4-5</ins>
---
![level45](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/11.png)
<br>
<pre>cat ./inhere/-file07</pre>
<br>
Again, you have to use the ```/``` before the file name.
<br>
![flag45](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/10.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 5-6</ins>
---
![level56](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/13.png)
<br>
<pre>find ./ -type f -size 1033c -exec cat {} \;</pre>
<br>
The hint is given that the file size is 1033 bytes, so I used the find command to get the flag. In the above command ```./``` is the current directory to look for, ```-type f``` is to look for files, ```-size 1033c``` is the size to look for with 1033c being the number of bytes of the file and ```-exec``` is used to execute a command.
<br>
![flag56](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/12.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 6-7</ins>
---
![level67](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/15.png)
<br>
<pre>find / -user bandit7 -type f -size 33c -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null</pre>
<br>
This is the same as the previous level with one change. The ```-user``` is used to look for files that are owned by the user ```bandit7```.
<br>
![flag67](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/14.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 7-8</ins>
---
![level78](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/17.png)
<br>
<pre>cat data.txt | grep millionth</pre>
<br>
```|``` pipe is used to pipe the data to another command and ```grep``` is used to filter the matching expression.
<br>
![flag78](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/16.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 8-9</ins>
---
![level89](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/19.png)
<br>
<pre>cat data.txt |sort| uniq -u</pre>
<br>
The ```sort``` command is used to sort the given input and ```uniq -u``` is used to get the unique line.
<br>
![flag89](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/18.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 9-10</ins>
---
![level910](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/21.png)
<br>
<pre>strings data.txt | grep =====</pre>
<br>
The ```strings``` command is used to get the human readable format of the file.
<br>
![flag910](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/20.png)
<br>

## <ins>Level 10-11</ins>
---
![level1011](/assets/img/otw/bandit/1-10/23.png)
<br>
<pre>cat data.txt |sort| uniq -u | base64 -d</pre>
<br>
The ```base64 -d``` decodes the base64 encoded strings.
