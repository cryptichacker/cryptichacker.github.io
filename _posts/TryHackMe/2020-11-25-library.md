Let's start with a nmap scan.

<br>
Only the ssh and http services are open. Let's check the http service.
<br>

<br>
Use ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories.
<br>
<pre>gobuster dir -u http://remote-ip-addr/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -t 50 -x php,html,txt,js</pre>
<br>

<br>
Checked the ```robots.txt``` file but found nothing useful.
<br>

<br>

After looking around for a while, found the username ```meliodas``` in the homepage.
<br>

## <ins>User flag</ins>

I used ```hydra``` to find the password for the user ```meliodas```
<br>
<pre>hydra -l meliodas -P ~/Wordlists/rockyou.txt remote-ip-addr ssh</pre>
<br>
![hydra](/assets/img/tryhackme/library/7.png)
<br>
Let's login to ssh using the credentials we just found
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/library/6.png)
<br>
Boom!! We got the user flag. Let's get going to the root flag.

## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
I used ```sudo -l``` to get the files that can run by root.
<br>

<br>
There is a file named ```bak.py``` which can be run as root...but wait it cannot be edited by the user ```meliodas```.

So, let's create a new file.
<b>
<pre>
rm bak.py
touch bak.py
echo 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' > bak.py
sudo python /home/meliodas/bak.py</pre>
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/library/9.png)

The root flag is in the ```/root``` directory.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
