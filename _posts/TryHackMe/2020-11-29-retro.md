<p>Retro is a hard level room in Tryhackme but in my opinion it is a intermediate level room. The exploits for this room are way too easy to find. The objective is to get the user and root flag.</p>

First up is our usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/retro/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
The ports ```80/http``` and ```3389/rdp``` are open.

The http service shows that the server runs ```Microsoft IIS``` service.
<br>

<br>
Run ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories.
<br>

<br>
This answers the first question.

Moving into the directory the first thing I noticed is the username ```Wade```.

After looking through some of his posts I found the password.

## <ins>User flag</ins>

Fire up Remmina to connect to the ```RDP``` service. Fill up the credentials that we just found.
<br>

<br>
Click on ```Save and Connect``` and the wait for the windows desktop to show up.

In the desktop we can see the ```user flag```.
<br>

<br>
We got the user flag. Let's move to the root flag.


## <ins>Root flag</ins>

I saw the hint given for the root flag and found that it was something to do with history. And this caught my attention...
<br>

<br>
I also checked the history of chrome and saw that the user has visited the same website.

The exploit and demo on how to exploit the vulnerability was given in the [github page](https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-1388) of the author. And I found the  exploit in recycle bin of the machine which made my work easier.
<br>

<br>
I tried to run the exploit by following the demo but I was stuck in the portion where the certificate should be opened in the browser.

Instead, I found this [exploit](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/blob/master/CVE-2017-0213/CVE-2017-0213_x64.zip) on github.

Download the zip file, unzipp it and transfer it to the remote machine using ```python```.
<br>

<br>
And finally execute it.
<br>
![exploit_run](/assets/img/tryhackme/retro/15.png)
<br>
The Administrator's command prompt pops up.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/retro/16.png)
<br>
Bingo!! We got the root flag.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
