**Description** | This room is based on the original Pokemon series. Can you obtain all the Pokemon in this room?

<p>Deploy the VM and lets go.</p>

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start with a nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
I checked the ```http service``` and I noticed the logo for the apache2 was missing.
<br>
![apache_2](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/2.png)
<br>
So, I checked the source page and found this.
<br>
![ssh_creds](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/3.png)
<br>
I tried this credentials for the ```ssh service``` and it worked.

## <ins>Grass flag</ins>
---
After logging into ```ssh``` I found a zip file in the dir ```/Desktop```.
<br>
![zip_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/5.png)
<br>
I unzipped the file.
<br>
<pre>unzip file-name.zip</pre>
<br>
![unzip_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/6.png)
<br>
After reading the file inside the inflated directory I found that it is ```hex``` encoded.
<br>
![grass_type](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/7.png)
<br>
I decoded it using ```cyberchef```.
<br>

<br>
That'll give the answer to the first question.


## <ins>Water flag</ins>
---
Following the first flag, I figured the naming pattern and just used ```locate``` to get the flags location.
<br>
<pre>locate water-type.txt</pre>
<br>
![water_type](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/9.png)
<br>
Again, I used ```cyberchef``` to decode the text but this time it was ```rot13``` cipher with a key of 14.
<br>

## <ins>Fire flag</ins>
---
Again, I used the same ```locate``` command to get the location of the flag.
<br>
![fire_type](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/11.png)
<br>
I used the command line ```base64``` tool to decode the text.
<br>
<pre> echo "base64-content" | base64 -d</pre>
<br>
![fire_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/12.png)
<br>


## <ins>Roots flag</ins>
---
I had no luck with the ```locate``` command this time. So, I manually searched through the directories. And finally, I found this file which had the password for the user ```ash```.
<br>
![ash_passwd](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/13.png)
<br>
Then I changed the user to ash.
<br>
<pre>su ash</pre>
<br>
I found the ```roots flag``` in the ```/home``` directory.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/pokemon/14.png)
<br>
Viola!! We got all the flags.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
