<p>NerdHerd is a Tryhackme room based on the TV series "Chuck". The final objective is to get the user and root flag.</p>

**Description** | Hack your way into this easy/medium level legendary TV series "Chuck" themed box!


Frankly, I haven't heard of this series but who cares!! Deploy the VM and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start with a nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/nmap_scan.png)
<br>

From the nmap scan we can see that Anonymous login is allowed in the ftp service. I logged into the ftp service as a ```Anonymous``` user and found a image and a hidden directory inside the base directory ```/pub```.
<br>
![ftp_service](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/2.png)
<br>
![hidden_dir](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/3.png)
<br>
Download both the files.
<br>
<pre> get file-name</pre>
<br>

The text file pointed to the keyword ```leet``` which also means ```1337```.
<br>
![google_res](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/4.png)
<br>

Let's move to the http service running on the ```port 1337```. 

Two alerts poped up after going into the webpage.
<br>
![alert_1](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/6.png)
![alert_2](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/7.png)
<br>

I looked into the source page and found some comments.
<br>
![comment_1](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/8.png)
<br>
![comment_2](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/9.png)
<br>
![comment_3](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/10.png)
<br>

And at the end of the source page I found a youtube link
<br>
![youtube_link](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/11.png)
<br>

After looking at the video name I guessed that the hint revolves around the word ```bird``` but  I was not sure if it is ```bird``` or ```birdistheword``` or ```bird is the word```. So, I just took a note of it.
<br>
![birdistheword](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/12.png)
<br>

After hitting a dead end, i decided to use gobuster and found the directory ```/admin```.
<br>
![admin_dir](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/13.png)
<br>

I found a comment on the source page but don't bother decoding it. It is just a dud.
<br>
![comments](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/14.png)
<br>

I couldn't enumerate the username and password for the login page, so let's move to smb service.

## <ins>SMB Enumeration</ins>
---
Use smbclient to enumerate the smb ports
<br>
![smb_enum1](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/15.png)
<br>

From the image we can see that there is a share named ```nerdherd_classfied```. I tried accessing it but my effort was in vain. So, I used ```enum4linux```.
<br>
<pre>enum4linux ip-addr</pre>
<br>
![enum4linux](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/16.png)
<br>

Got the username ```chuck```.

Another dead end. I tried bruteforcing using ```hydra``` but it took a hell lot of time. Instead here is a shortcut.

Use exiftool on the image we first found on the ftp server.
<br>
<pre>exiftool youfoundme.png</pre>
<br>
And notice the ```Owner Name``` field.
<br>
![exiftool](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/17.png)
<br>
It is vigenere-cipher with the key ```birdistheword```. We can get the password for the smb service for the username ```chuck```.
<br>
![passwd_crack](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/18.png)
<br>

Login to smb using the username ```chuck```.
<br>
<pre>smbclient //10.10.84.135/nerdherd_classified --user=chuck</pre>
<br>

Found a text file in the folder. Download it using...
<br>
<pre>get file-name</pre>
<br>
![secret_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/19.png)
<br>

The file contains a path to a hidden directory in the webpage.
<br>
![hidden_dir](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/20.png)
<br>


## <ins> User flag</ins>
---
After visiting the dir we can get the credentials for ssh.
<br>
![ssh_creds](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/21.png)
<br>

Without further wait, let's login to ssh.
<br>
![ssh_login](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/22.png)
<br>
Bingo!!! We got the user flag.


## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
After looking around for a while I found this...
<br>
![os_info](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/23.png)
<br>

I searched ```exploit-db``` and found a kernel exploit which matched with the linux version of the machine. Here is a [link to exploit](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45010).
<br>
![exploit_info](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/24.png)
<br>

I copied the contents of the exploit into the machine and named it ```exploit.c```.

To run a ```c file``` we must first compile it.
<br>
<pre>gcc -o exploit exploit.c</pre>
<br>
Change the permissions of the compiled file.
<br>
<pre>chmod +x exploit</pre>
<br>
And finally run the file.
<br>
<pre>./exploit</pre>
<br>
![root_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/25.png)
<br>
And boom!!! We'll get the root shell.

Searched for ```root flag``` in the usual place but the ```root.txt``` file found in the ```/root``` dir seems like a dud.
<br>
![root_flag_dud](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/26.png)
<br>

So, I used ```locate``` to get the location of ```root flag```.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/27.png)
<br>

Finally got the root flag but wait there is still the bonus flag.

## <ins>Bonus flag</ins>
---
I tried using tools like ```locate``` and ```find``` but there was no luck.

Atlast I found the bonus flag in the file ```/root/.bash_history```
<br>
![bonus_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/nerdherd/29.png)
<br>

All three flag obtained and successfully rooted the box.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
