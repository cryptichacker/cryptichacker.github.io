Cyborg is a beginner level room in Tryhackme. The only thing I found hard in this box was to retrieve a backup archive. One thing to definitely mention is the script to get the root shell which made the box more like a CTF. The final objective is to get the user and root flag.

Deploy the VM and let's Hack the machine.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start enumerating with the usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
The ports ```22/ssh``` and ```80/http``` are open. The nmap scan should answer the first three questions.

After looking at the http service I found apache2 index page.
<br>

<br>
I ran ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories in the webpage.
<br>
![gobuster_results](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/3.png)
<br>
Going through the results, I decided to take a look at the ```/admin``` page first. I found this conversation after clicking on the ```Admins``` link in the top bar.
<br>
![conversation_alex](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/4.png)
<br>
From the conversation there is a keyword "music_archive" which I found was interesting. Then I downloaded a archive from the "Archive" dropdown.
<br>
![archive_dropdown](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/9.png)
<br>

Navigating to the ```/etc/squid``` directory I found two files.
<br>
![etc_squid](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/5.png)
<br>
The passwd file has a encrypted password.
<br>
<pre>music_archive:$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.</pre>
<br>
And the configuration file squid.conf had...
<br>
![squid_conf](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/6.png)
<br>
After checking the hash using ```hash-identifier``` from the passwd file, I found that it encrypted using ```MD5(APR)``` encryption algorithm.
<br>
![hash_id](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/7.png)
<br>
I checked the code in the hash examples from the hashcat webpage and used it to crack the password.
<br>
<pre>
hashcat -a 0 -m 1600 hash.txt path-to-rockyou.txt

#hash.txt contains the password hash</pre>
<br>

<br>

## <ins>Borg backup archive</ins>
---
I extracted the archive using ```tar``` and it inflated into ```./home``` directory.
<br>
![tar_extract](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/10.png)
<br>
I manually went through all the files that are inside the ```./home``` directory and the only piece of information I got is the documentation link from the ```README``` file.
<br>
![readme_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/11.png)
<br>
I installed the ```borgbackup``` repository using ```apt```.
<br>
<pre>sudo apt-get install borgbackup</pre>
<br>
Reading through the documentation, I first understood what ```borgbackup``` was.
<br>
![borg_backup](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/13.png)
<br>
I found a way to extract the ```music_archive``` from the man pages.
<br>
![man_page](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/12.png)
<br>
![borg_extract](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/14.png)
<br>
Enter the password which we cracked using hashcat.

## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
After the completion of the extraction we can see another dir inside the ```/home``` directory named ```Alex```. There are two text files one of which gave away the password for the user Alex.
<br>

<br>
Thanks for the shoutout.
<br>

<br>

Ssh-ing into the machine we can get the user flag.
<br>

<br>


## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
After doing some priviledge escation enumeration, I found a file which can be run as root.
<br>
![sudo_l](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/18.png)
<br>
After taking a closer look, the file ```/backup.sh``` is owned by ```alex``` and can be run as ```root```.
<br>
![backup_sh](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/19.png)
<br>
After executing the file, I found that it backed up some files. I read the contents of the file and found this part interesting.
<br>
![c_argument](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/20.png)
<br>
It seems that we can add an optional argument ```-c``` wihle running the file. We can exploit this to get the root shell.
<br>
<pre>sudo ./backup.sh -c "/bin/bash"</pre>
<br>
![root_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/21.png)
<br>
I got the root shell, but wait...the shell doesn't return anything for any comands. So, I grabbed the bash reverse shell payload and ran it. Remember to open a netcat listener in your local machine.
<br>
![root_reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/cyborg/22.png)
<br>
The root flag will be waiting for you in the ```/root``` directory.
<br>

<br>
Nice!! Box rooted.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
