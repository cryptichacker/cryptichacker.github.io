<p>Mnemonic is a fun room and the final objective is to get the user and root flag.</p>

**Description** | I hope you have fun.


<p>Deploy the VM and lets go.</p>

## <ins>Task 1</ins>
---
Just watch the youtube video and hit the completed button. Let's move to the second task.

## <ins>Task 2</ins>
---
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
<p>The nmap scan results shows that there are 3 ports open and SSH runs on a specific port. This answers the first two questions. I tried to login ftp service but it seems anonymous login is not enabled.</p>
<p>From the nmap scan it seems we can access the robots.txt file.</p>
<p>Or we can use gobuster to find the hidden directories.</p>
<br>
<pre>gobuster dir -u http://ip-addr/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -t 70 -x php,html,js,txt</pre>

<br>
![gobuster_root_folder](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/2.png)
<br>
<p> Again use gobuster in the /webmasters directory.</p>
<br>
![gobuster_webmasters](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/3.png)
<br>

<p>I checked the /admin directory and found a login page but I couldn't go any further.</p>

<p>So, I tried to access the /backups directory but it just loads and there is only a blank screen.</p>

<p>Just use gobuster to find the hidden file.</p>
<br>
<pre>gobuster dir -u http://ip-addr/webmasters/backups -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -t 70 -x php,html,js,txt,zip,rar,sql</pre>
<br>

## <ins>Task 3</ins>
---

<p>The zip file is password protected.</p>
<p>Crack it using fcrackzip.</p>
<br>
<pre>fcrackzip -D -p path-to-wordlist -u zip-file.zip</pre>

<br>
![fcrackzip_answer](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/7.png)
<br>
<p>After unzipping the zip file with the cracked password, I found a text file. The text file seems like a message for a user named James and it gives the username for the ftp service</p>
<p>Use hydra to get the password for the user</p>
<br>

![hydra_ftp](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/6.png)
<br>

<p>Without further delay lets login to ftp service</p>
<p>Found two files in the directory</p>
<p> Download it using the get command</p>
<br>
<pre>get file-name</pre>
<br>
<p>The not.txt is just a message for the user <b>James</b></p>

<p>With the private ssh key downloaded from ftp I changed the permissions and tried to login to ssh but...another obstacle...it is password protected. Convert it to hash using ssh2john.</p>
<br>
<pre>/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > hash.txt</pre>
<br>
<p>And crack the hash using john.</p>
<br>
![john_crack](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/9.png)
<br>
<p>The cracked password is the ssh password for the user <b>James</b> Login to ssh using the credentials.</p>
<br>

![ssh_login](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/10.png)
<br>
<p>Atlast....logged into ssh. Let's get going.</p>
<p>Sometime after I logged into the machine the machine executes a program and the system reboots itself.</p>
<br>
![IPS_program](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/11.png)
<br>
<p>I logged into the machine again and tried to enumerate before the program executes and reboots the system.</p>
<p>In the home directory of the user james I found two text files.</p>
<br>
![home_dir_james](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/12.png)

<br>
<p>I copied the contents of the two text files in my local machine.</p>
<p>Next, I tried to find executables which can be run as root.</p>
<br>
![find_fail](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/13.png)

<br>
<p>Without redirecting the output I used the find command and found some interesting files.</p>

<br>
![files_list](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/14.png)

<br>
<p>Both of the files seems to have base64 names.</p>
<p> I tried decoding it and found the user flag and a link to a image.</p>
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/25.png)

<br>
![image_link](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/26.png)
<br>

Here is the [link](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K-96JmC2AkE/maxresdefault.jpg)
<p>Download the image</p>

<p>I saw the hint for finding condor's password.</p>
<br>
![hint](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/15.png)

<br>
<p>I searched in google and came across the link.</p>
<br>
![google_link](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/16.png)

<br>
<p>Clone the repository.</p>
<br>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/MustafaTanguner/Mnemonic.git</pre>
<br>

![page_readme](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/27.png)
<br>

<p>Follow the instruction given in the github page for the installation of python libraries and finally run the python file.</p>
<br>
<pre>python3 Mnemonic.py</pre>

<br>
![run_file](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/17.png)
<br>

<p>Enter the image path, choose decrypt and enter the text file name.</p>
<br>
![decryption](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/18.png)

<br>
<p> And we'll get the answer to the last question in the task i.e, condor's password.</p>


## <ins>Task 4</ins>
---
<p>Login to ssh with the username condor.</p>

<br>
![ssh_condor](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/19.png)
<br>

### <ins>User flag</ins>

<br>
<p>We already got the user flag when decoding one of the filename. So, let's move onto the root flag.</p>
<br>
<p>In case you didn't get it. Here...</p>
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/25.png)
<br>

### <ins>Root flag</ins>

<br>
<p> I found a file which is owned by root.</p>

<br>
![sudo_check](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/20.png)
<br>
![sudo_check1](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/21.png)

<br>
<p>I tried running the file and chose the most interesting option but it rebooted the system. So, I tried checking all the other options but nothing seemed suspicous.</p>

<br>
<p>After a while, I checked the code of the file and this part caught my attention.</p>
<br>

![interesting_part](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/22.png)

<br>
<p>I ran the file again, choose the exit(0) option, instead of giving "yes" I used a period and finally the root shell spawned after giving the path as <b>"/bin/sh"</b>.</p>

<br>
![root_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/23.png)

<br>
<p>Go to the /root dir and you'll see the root flag waiting for you...</p>
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/mnemonic/24.png)

<p>Don't forget to MD5 encrypt the contents of the root flag before submitting.</p>

That's it folks. Happy Hacking!!!!
