Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Following the nmap scan, I found that the ports ```22/ssh```, ```80/http``` and the port ```3306/sql``` are open.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
Firstly, I checked the ```80/http``` port/service.
<br>
![http_service](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/5.png)
<br>
After checking the source page of the site, I found the vhost name ```spectra.htb```.
<br>
![vhost_name](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/2.png)
<br>
I added the host name to the ```/etc/hosts``` file in my local machine.
<br>
![etc_hosts](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/3.png)
<br>
Then, I ran ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories in the background. Meanwhile I checked the webpage.
<br>

<br>
I found that wordpress is configured in the ```/main``` directory of the webpage. I tried some common credentials in the ```wp-admin``` page but I was not successful. So, I took note of the username that is displayed in the main page of the wordpress site.
<br>
![wordpress_site](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/6.png)
<br>
Then, I checked the other directory ```/testing``` which listed out the files. One file that caught my attention was the ```wp-config.php.save``` file.
<br>
![listing_testing](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/7.png)
<br>
I downloaded the file. After going through the file, I found some credentials
<br>
![save_file](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/8.png)
<br>
I tried these credentials in the ```/main/wp-admin``` page but had no luck. After some trial and errors, I found that the username is ```administrator``` and the password is the same as mentioned in the file.
<br>

<br>


<ins>Exploitation</ins>
---
I copied the php-reverse-shell.php file into the local working directory and changed the ip and port fields. Then, I switched to theme editor in the wp-admin page and changed the contents of the ```404.php``` file of the twentynineteen theme with the contents of the reverse shell file.
<br>
![theme_editor](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/10.png)
<br>
I saved the file and opened a netcat listener in the local machine. To get the reverse shell go the url ```http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/404.php```
<br>
![revese_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/11.png)
<br>
Use the command ```python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'``` to stabilize the shell.


<ins>User flag</ins>
---
I transferred the ```linpeas.sh``` file but couldn't run it. The output displayed the message ```Permission Denied```. So, I started manually enumerating the box.

After going through some directories, I found an interesting file in the ```/opt``` directory with the name ```autologin.conf.orig```
<br>
![auto_login](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/12.png)
<br>
Afer reading the file, I found the path ```/etc/autologin```. Moving to the specified path, I found an file named ```passwd``` which contained the password for one of the user accounts.
<br>
![passwd_file](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/13.png)
<br>
The usernames that I enumerated are:
<br>
![user_names](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/14.png)
<br>
I used ```hydra``` to get the username for the password.
<br>
<pre>hydra -L usernames.txt -p the_found_password spectra.htb -t 4 ssh</pre>
<br>
And after bruteforcing the usernames, found the username to be ```katie```. After logging in to the ssh service we can get the user flag in the home dorectory.
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/15.png)
<br>
We got the user flag. Let's move to the root flag.


<ins>Root flag</ins>
---
I made the ```linpeas.sh``` to run in another terminal. Meanwhile, I did some basic privilege escalation enumeration. After using ```sudo -l``` found that the service ```/sbin/initctl``` can be run as root.
<br>
![sudo_l](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/16.png)
<br>
Basically, initctl allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with the Upstart init daemon. For more information, refer the linux man pages.

I tried listing the services. But there was like a huge list that was displayed in the output. As I went through some of them, I found some common services in the name ```test*``` in the services listed. So, I tried using grep.
<br>
<pre>sudo /sbin/initctl list | grep test</pre>
<br>
![grep_initctl](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/17.png)
<br>
And to find the location of the ```.conf``` files of these services...
<br>
<pre>find / -name test*.conf -type f 2>/dev/null</pre>
<br>
![conf_files](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/18.png)
<br>
I moved into the ```/etc/init``` directory to check for write permission for the files in the directory and confirmed that, I can edit the files.

After reading the file, I guessed the syntax and finally arrived at this.
<br>
<pre>
script
chmod +s /bin/bash
end script
</pre>
<br>
I changed the contents of the ```test.conf``` file to the above code.

Then, I ran the some commands to start the service.
<br>
<pre>sudo /sbin/initctl start test</pre>
<br>

After starting the service, I used ```/bin/bash -p``` to run the ```bash``` file as the ```root``` user.
<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/hackthebox/spectra/20.png)
<br>
And there we go...we got the root flag.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
