Connect to ```Hackthebox``` and let's go.

## <ins>Enumeration</ins>
---

I started enumerating using ```nmap```.
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/hackthebox/openkeys/nmap_scan.png)
<br>

The ```ssh``` and the ```http``` ports are open. I checked the ```http``` service and saw this login page. I tried some common credentials but had no luck.
<br>

<br>
I used ```gobuster``` to bruteforce the hidden directories.

<br>
In the ```/includes``` dir of the webpage I found two files.
<br>

<br>
The ```auth.php.swp``` had some interesting information.
<br>

<br>
I added ```jenniferopenkeys.htb``` to the ```/etc/hosts``` files. Note this code that I've highlighted.


### <ins>Login Bypass</ins>
---
As I was enumerating, I found this [page](https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt) about ***openbsd authentication vulnerability***.

### <ins>SSH key</ins>
---
I successfully bypassed the login. After login, this error shows up.
<br>

<br>
This was the part I was stuck for a very long time.

I was messing with the field values using ```burpsuite``` and had quite a bit of unsuccessful tries. So, after the reading the code this worked for me. I appended ```;username=jennifer``` to the ```Cookie``` field and clicked on ```Follow redirection``` in burpsuite.
<br>

<br>

My guess is that ```$_REQUEST['username']``` that I highlighted in the previous image also gets the username value from the ```Cookie``` which is used as the ```Session username``` instead of the username from ```request body```.

We'll get the ssh private key for the user ```jennifer```.

<br>


## <ins> User flag</ins>
---
Login to ```ssh``` using the private key.
<br>
<pre>ssh jennifer@10.10.10.199 -i private-key</pre>
<br>
![ssh_login](/assets/img/hackthebox/openkeys/14.png)
<br>
Boom!! We got the user flag. Let's move to root flag.
<br>

## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
After running the command ```uname -a``` on the remote machine, I found that it is not running the latest version of the operating system. I searched for some publicly available exploits and I came across this github page with the ```priviledge escalation exploit```.

Here is the [link to exploit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcoles/local-exploits/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot). This exploit is used to gain ```auth``` group permissions via ```xlock```.

I couldn't create a file in the user's home directory so, I moved to the ```/tmp``` dir and copied the contents of the exploit to a file.

Give the ```execution``` permission for the file.
<br>
<pre>chmod +x exploit-file-name</pre>
<br>
Finally, run the file with ```./exploit-file-name```.
<br>
![root_user](/assets/img/hackthebox/openkeys/15.png)
<br>
The root flag will be waiting for you in the ```/root``` directory.

That's it folks. Happy hacking!!!
