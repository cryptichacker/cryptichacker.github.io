Hi there!!

I am basically a cyber security enthusiast and I challenge myself to learn new stuff everyday.

I like doing CTFs, coding, gaming, watching anime and doing stuff..

My aim right now is to start a blog.

My favourite quote is from Rock Lee who is a character in Naruto Shippuden
<br>
**_“My motto is to be stronger than yesterday, if I have to I’ll be stronger than half a day ago, even a minute ago.”_**

Thanks for reading my blog.
